<h1>United Football Academy and My Journey</h1> 
<div style="text-align:center"> 
<h2> A Summary of my life with Soccer </h2>
</div>
<P> My parents put me in a soccer club when I was around four or five years old. The club was called <abbr title="Norcross Soccer Academy">NSA</abbr> and the name changed when I was in middle school. It's now called <abbr title="United Football Academy">UFA</abbr>. I was never really good at soccer when I was younger, but my parents thought of it as a good way to exercise. As I got older starting in middle school, my skills were improving significantly. I was always on the second team growing up, called <i> Red team </i> and in my eighth grade year I made it to the top team, called <i> Premier </i>. This was very exciting for me because I was on the best team in the academy of my age group. I remained on this team until I left the academy during my high school years.  </p>

<p> As I stated already, I started out with the club when I was only four or five years old. The club was called Norcross Soccer Academy back then. The academy joined with a bigger club which resulted in the name change of UFA. You'll find more details about the differences between NSA and UFA <a href="file:///C:/Users/OWNER/Google%20Drive/csci%20lab/labs/page2.html">here.</a> </p>


<h3> More on how the academy works </h3>

<p>There are about five teams in each age group. The teams are divided by sex, therefore boys and girls seperately.
There are team levels in each age group:</p></body>

<p> The top two team levels practiced more than the others. This being said, I spent most of my time at the fields becasue of practice and games. I practiced three times a week for an hour a half. Below is an example of what my soccer scheduled looked like in a time span of a week. </p>
