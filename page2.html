<p> The old colors of Norcross Soccer Academy (the old name of the club) were blue and yellow as can be seen in the lower image.The new colors that have been in place since 2010 are red and black. When playing home games, which are at the UFA fields, we wear the black jersey and wore the blue jersey with the old uniforms.When we go out to play a game we wear the red jerseys and wore the yellow with NSA. Home games are always the darker colors and away games are always the ligter colors. </p>
<p> Another difference on how the club changed other than just the colors and logo is how it joined a much bigger club. United Football Academy was a club on its own, but it began buying other soccer academys. As can be seen, UFA bought NSA and now NSA was part of a much bigger academy.The way we distinguish from the different locations of the United Football Academy are by locations. For example, Norcross Soccer Academy was now United Football Acadmey Norcorss. UFA Norcross is the common name. Very rarely do people say the full name. Becasue NSA joined to become UFA Norcross, it brought more players from around Georgia to the academy, henceforth bringing more money into the academy.
